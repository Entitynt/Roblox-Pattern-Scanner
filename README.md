# Roblox Pattern Scanner

Hello I am new to c++ I have not had much IDA experience yes it is a terrible code but it is a very simple project if beginners do not skid and make an effort to understand it
thanks to zayn here for explaining the address system and thanks to usrdottik for helping me find Fireproximityprompt.
